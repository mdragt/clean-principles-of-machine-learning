    "# Support Vector Machine Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support vector machines (SVMs)** are a widely used and powerful category of machine learning algorithms. There are many variations on the basic idea of an SVM. An SVM attempts to **maximally separate** classes by finding the **support vector** with the lowest error rate or maximum separation. SVMs can use many types of **kernel functions**. The most common kernel functions are **linear** and the **radial basis function** or **RBF**. The linear basis function attempts to separate classes by finding hyperplanes in the feature space that maximally separate classes. The RBF uses set of local Gaussian shaped basis kernels to find a nonlinear separation of the classes. "
